# Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching Notes. Each Note can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to Notes that he/she has created.

This application uses spaced repatition to help you review your notes.


## Frontend

To run a client application:

```
cd spa
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless Notes application.
